# Fuel Consumption

**Fuel consumption** is a program to help determine adequate amount of fuel required to cover a specific set distance. 
This is a borrowed idea from the concept that airplanes use to calculate the amount of fuel required before the plane
takes off from the ground.

Having knowledge of the amount of fuel to be used in a safari reduces surprises such as fuel shortage. Running out of fuel mid-safari 
can be dangerous and inconveniencing, especially in remote area and unfavourable weather conditions. 
Calculating the amount of fuel required before the safari ensures that a person avoid such inconveniences.
	
Secondly, harsh economic times have forced people to be working with budgets. Using the fuel consumption program 
helps an individual budget accordingly. This results in better management of expenses and making informed choices about fuel purchases.

Thirdly, calculating the amount of fuel to be consumed allows for proper route planning. With proper route planning, detours and unnecessary
stops are eliminated resulting in saving time and money.

Finally, having enough fuel for a safari gives an individual *peace of mind*. Simple doubts about having enough fuel for the safari 
are eliminated leaving the driver with room to focus on the road and enjoy the journey.
